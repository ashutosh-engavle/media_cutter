# Media Processing Utilities

This repository contains two Python utilities for media file processing. The first utility, `list_media.py`, scans a specified directory (and all its subdirectories) for audio and video files, listing their paths and lengths in a JSON file. The second utility, `cut_media.py`, reads a JSON file with media information and cuts media files to a new length if specified.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `moviepy` library
- `tqdm` library

You can install the required Python libraries using pip:

```sh
pip install moviepy tqdm
```

## Utility 1: Listing Media Files (`list_media.py`)

### Usage

Run the script from the command line, providing the path to the directory you want to scan as an argument:

```sh
python list_media.py "<path_to_directory>"
```

### Output

The script generates a `media_info.json` file in the current working directory, containing the paths, lengths, and new lengths (initially set to the same as lengths) of all found audio and video files.

## Utility 2: Cutting Media Files (`cut_media.py`)

### Usage

This script reads a JSON file (like the one generated by `list_media.py`) and cuts media files to a new length if the `new_length` is less than the original `length`. To use this utility, run:

```sh
python cut_media.py "<path_to_json_file>"
```

### Important Notes

- Ensure the JSON file is properly formatted and includes `new_length` values for the files you wish to cut.
- The script generates new media files with `_cut` appended to the original filenames to avoid overwriting the originals.

## General Notes

- Both utilities use MIME types to determine whether a file is audio or video, ensuring a wide range of file formats can be processed.
- Progress is displayed in the console using a progress bar, providing feedback during processing.
- These scripts are designed for batch processing of media files and can handle large directories and numerous files efficiently.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter errors related to file handling or library dependencies, ensure you have the latest versions of Python and the required libraries installed. For issues with specific media files, verify that the files are not corrupted and are in a format supported by the `moviepy` library.
